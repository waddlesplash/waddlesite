# waddlesite
A simple template-based website system that has a goal of making it easy to make rich websites with minimal knowledge of HTML.

## how to use
[See the documentation.](https://github.com/waddlesplash/waddlesite/wiki)

## is there an example?
This repo *is* an example. Pop it into a webserver and run it.

## how do I do [something]?
If you're stumped (AFTER reading the documentation) perhaps I forgot to document something. If so, [file a bug report](https://github.com/waddlesplash/waddlesite/issues/new) with your question. It may end up being that you *can't* do whatever you want to do (yet!) so your question may turn into a feature request.

## but I want it to do [some feature name here]
Well, I'm not you, and I didn't need it to do that. But if it's not too hard or impractical, I'll happily implement it for you. First [check if someone hasn't asked already](https://github.com/waddlesplash/waddlesite/issues), and if not, [file a bug report](https://github.com/waddlesplash/waddlesite/issues/new) with the word "feature" somewhere in the description.
